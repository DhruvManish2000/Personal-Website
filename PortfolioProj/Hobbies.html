<h1>
Soccer

</h1>

<p>
I have been playing soccer since 2015. It is something I like doing outside school and programming. <br>
I have made a lot of connections through this sport in intermurals or the Edmonton Soccer Association. <br> 
It has also allowed me to stay fit and healthy throughout the year. <br> <br>

Player Porfolio: <br> <br>

Preferred Position: Right Back <br> 
Preferred foot: Right

<!-- Need a picture of me playing soccer or something like that -->
